# Extension
 
The title of this extension is Lead Tracker, though I prefer to consider it a link/idea saver which you can use while you are working on research or anything that would involve a lot of brainstorming ideas or tabs for you to hold in one place.

 - Has an input field, where you can write down anything you want to save.

 - Save input, saves the text noted on the input field. It will display as a link anchor and will send you to that tab.

 - Save tab is contected to an Chrome API that allows you to save the tab you are in as a input.

 - If you were to close the browser and reopen it, every input will continue to be saved because everything lives in local storage.

Despite being challenging was as well alot of fun. If you have any recommendation for me to add would truly adore and appreciate it.
